      <p>
        All these services are hosted by me. I'm not using hosting providers. I
        will be using my own pc or some vps.
      </p>
      <p>
        All services connect to databases using the backend service that uses
        golang. This way I can secure the db (that isn't setup and configured
        yet) so that only one service can access it.
